Hello! I made this for fun to try to learn more about react, turns out it's harder than I thought and simple things like using the API was annoying.

My main idea was to embed spotify & use the tour API to display up to date band info, I ran into problems with the API in that I can't figure out how to turn the date into a readable format using react. I'm sure there's some simple answer but I simply can't figure it out.

The tour info be automatically correct which is cool I guess but it would have been 10 times easier in vanilla javascript, I guess I learned how to do it now so it will be easier in the future.

I'm not too happy with how the whole thing turned out and the code is a damn mess of half react-bootstrap and half normal bootstrap as react-bootstrap wouldn't work as well as normal bootstrap. I also had to end up overriding a bunch of things, writing the same stuff over and over a lot or copy and pasting because bootstrap would interfere. 



I learned quite a lot by simply just winging it and learning new things as I went ¯\(°_o)/¯
