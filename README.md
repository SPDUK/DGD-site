Hello! I made this for fun to try to learn more about react, turns out it's harder than I thought and simple things like using the API was incredibly hard.

My main idea was to embed spotify & use the tour API to display up to date band info, I ran into problems with the API in that I can't figure out how to change the state of the date to a readable nice looking date, or update the URL with today's date as the bandsintown API has an awkward URL I can't figure out how to easily
